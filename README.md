# multimodal-recognition
The primary aim of this project is to design and develop a multimodal biometric system that integrates facial recognition and speaker verification to achieve robust person identification. By combining these modalities, the system will address the limitations of unimodal approaches, such as susceptibility to noise and variations in environmental conditions, and deliver
higher accuracy and reliability.
The objectives of the project include:

• Research and Analysis: Review and analyse current trends and techniques in facial recognition, speaker verification, and multimodal sys-
terms.

• System Design: Develop a framework that effectively integrates CNN-
based facial recognition and RNN-based speaker verification.

• Noise Mitigation: Employ advanced noise reduction techniques, such
as attention mechanisms to improve performance in challenging en-
vironments.

• Implementation and Testing: Implement the system using tools like
Python, OpenCV, Pyaudio, and MATLAB, and conduct rigorous
testing under diverse scenarios.

• User Interface Development: Create a user-friendly interface compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms.

• Ethical Considerations: Ensure compliance with data privacy and
security regulations while addressing ethical concerns related to biometric systems.
